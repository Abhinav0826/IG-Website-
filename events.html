        Single-use plastic degrades into microplastic which pollutes the environment. It is alarming to note that microplastic is now found on the most remote mountaintops and in the deepest oceans. Single-use plastic destroys the ecological balance and has extremely detrimental long-term implications
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        ECOVISION is an initiative by CII in alignment with the call from the Ministry of Education towards the elimination of single-use plastic. We aim to spread awareness and celebrate the fusion of nature with sustainable and eco-friendly technologies.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        As part of the ECOVISION initiative, CII will host talks from subject matter experts to highlight the problems and opportunities for sustainable innovation followed by a hackathon in which students showcase their innovative projects. This is a golden opportunity for engineering enthusiasts to showcase their creativity through ideas that push for our sustainable development and stand a chance to win prototype translational support.

      <p>Namaste! Ever heard the terms fork and clone being used by software developers? It does sound silly, we digress, but Git is one of the most important tools for a software engineer. Innovation Garage is here to give you the low down on GitHub and Open Source Tools. We’ll teach you cloning, forking and installing repositories as well as give you an insight on how to participate in Hacktoberfest, a month long celebration of Open Source software.<p>
